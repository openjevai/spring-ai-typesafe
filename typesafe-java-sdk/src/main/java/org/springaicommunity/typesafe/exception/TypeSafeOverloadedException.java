/**
 * Raised on HTTP 529 (TypeSafe's non-standard overload status) or HTTP 503 (OpenJEV's
 * service-unavailable), to say the API is temporarily overloaded. Retry after a short
 * delay.
 *
 * <p>
 * This extends {@link TypeSafeInternalServerException} rather than sitting beside it,
 * because both statuses are numerically 5xx and both official SDKs report 529 as their
 * internal-server error. Catching {@code TypeSafeInternalServerException} therefore still
 * catches an overload, exactly as the documented Python and JavaScript patterns do, while
 * catching this type narrows to the one status that is worth retrying on its own terms.
